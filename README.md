## Features and Tools

### Reverse Shell
- **Description:** A tool for establishing a reverse shell connection to a target machine, enabling remote command execution.

### Phishing Simulation
- **Description:** Simulates phishing scenarios to educate users on identifying and preventing phishing attacks.

### Wireshark Integration
- **Description:** Utilities for analyzing network traffic, identifying anomalies, and learning packet-level network behaviors.

### Keylogging
- **Description:** Demonstrates how keylogging works and highlights its security implications.

### Port Scanning
- **Description:** Identifies open ports on a target system to assess potential vulnerabilities.

### DLL Hijacking
- **Description:** Explores DLL hijacking techniques to understand exploitation methods and their mitigation in Windows environments.

### Decryption Utilities
- **Description:** Tools for decrypting files or strings, illustrating secure and insecure cryptographic practices.

### Buffer Overflow Exploitation
- **Description:** Simulates buffer overflow attacks to show vulnerabilities in unsafe memory handling.

### Rootkit Development
- **Description:** Implements basic rootkit functionality to demonstrate stealth techniques and their detection.
